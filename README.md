# E07b-Procedural-Generation

This is the 2d platformer for c220! i made all the assets except for the tileset and the music. The tileset is free for use, and the music is the same. 
My save and load feature was supposed to be a music player with options to change music and have it continue through the levels, but as of right now that feature is not functioning, so i have temporarily placed music in the levels seperate from the music player. If i can get this program to work, i shall remove the temporary measures. 
other than that, everything else should be in place.
